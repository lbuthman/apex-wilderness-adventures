#### In this package you will gain access to a rather wild, but typical, state for Apex automation. Logical nesting is high, design choices are inconsistent, and tests lack a greater purpose beyond merely code coverage. I use this resource to practice maintenance skills in a safe environment. Feel free to look around.
